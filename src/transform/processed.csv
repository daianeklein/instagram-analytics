3625179909652482815;Nothing could prepare me for the feeling I had during last nightâ€™s showâ€”the absolute pride and joy I felt singing for the people of Brazil. The sight of the crowd during my opening songs took my breath away. Your heart shines so bright, your culture is so vibrant and special, I hope you know how grateful I am to have shared this historical moment with you.  An estimated 2.5 million people came to see me sing, the biggest crowd for any woman in history.  I wish I could share this feeling with the whole worldâ€”I know I canâ€™t, but I can say thisâ€”if you lose your way, you can find your way back if you believe in yourself and work hard.  You can give yourself dignity by rehearsing your passion and your craft, pushing yourself to new heightsâ€” you can lift yourself up even if it takes some time.  Thank you Rio for waiting for me to come back.  Thank you little monsters all over the world. I love you. I will never forget this moment. Paws up little monsters. Obrigada. Love, Mother Monster.;4335818;04-05-2025;16:12
